generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits systematic generation of a specific class of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described in a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5 n - 1 specific permutations of n elements termed rosary permutations can be defined each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other and is generated successively by a number system covering 3*4*.* n-1 sets of edges every set of edges {e k } 1
