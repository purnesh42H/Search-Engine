connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound p=k is derived for the order of accuracy of a inf -stable formulas three criteria are given for a 0 -stability it is shown that 1 for p=k k arbitrary a inf -stability implies certain necessary conditions for a 0 -stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of p psi satisfy |psi|
